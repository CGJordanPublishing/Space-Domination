\section*{The rules}

Play on the table top. 1 unit = 1 cm, adjust if needed. You can use rulers, meter sticks, tape measures or any other straight edge to represent vectors.

Each player's starship has 3 damage points. When a starship gets hit by a torpedo or another starship, it loses a damage point. If a starship reaches 0 damage points, flip it over and draw an `X' on the back. Should a starship's movement cause it to fly off the edge of the table the starship's damage points is reduced to 0.

Each player's starship starts with 3 torpedoes

Roll a six sided die to determine turn order, highest roll goes first. On your turn you can either move your starship or lauch a torpedo.

When your starship moves it accelerates in the direction it is pointing. Where your ship moves to is defined by a vector, $\vec{v}$, where:
\begin{equation}
\vec{v}=\vec{a}+\vec{r}\label{smoveq}
\end{equation}
calculated using the \textbf{tail to tip} method.

\underline{The \textbf{tail to tip} method}

\begin{tikzpicture}
\draw[step=1cm, gray ,very thin] (-1,-1) grid (2,3);
\draw[very thick] (-1,0)--(2,0);
\draw[very thick] (0,-1)--(0,3);
\draw[->, thick] (0,0)--(1,1) node [anchor = west] {$\vec{r}$};
\draw[->, thick] (0,0)--(1,2) node [anchor = west] {$\vec{a}$};
\draw (0,0) node[anchor=north west] {0,0};

\draw[step=1cm, gray ,very thin] (3,-1) grid (6,3);
\draw[very thick] (3,0)--(6,0);
\draw[ very thick] (4,-1)--(4,3);
\draw[->, thick] (4,0)--(5,1) node [anchor = west] {$\vec{r}$};
\draw[->, thick] (5,1)--(6,3) node [anchor = west] {$\vec{a}$};
\draw[->, thick] (4,0)--(6,3) node [midway, sloped, above] {$\vec{v}$};
\draw (4,0) node[anchor=north west] {0,0};
\end{tikzpicture}

Given two vectors $\vec{a},\vec{r}$ adding them results in a new vector, $\vec{v}$. Note that two vectors that have the same magnitude and direction are equivalent no matter their position in the space.

When your ship moves it produces an acceleration vector, $\vec{a}$, with magnitude in units equal to the value rolled on a six-sided die that is in the direction of your ship's acceleration. When the game begins $\vec{r}=\vec{0}$, so on your first move $\vec{v}=\vec{a}$. On your turn before you move $\vec{r}$ is set to the $\vec{v}$ of the previous turn. On your next move you can accelerate again producing a new vector, $\vec{v}$ via eq.\ref{smoveq}.

While moving you may rotate your ship up to $180^\circ$ ($\pi$ radians) clockwise or counterclockwise.

When a torpedo is lauched the starship drifts along its $\vec{r}$. A topedo moves in the same fashion as a starship, but its initial direction is determined by the direction the launching starship is pointed, and the magnitude of the torpedo's $\vec{a}$ is always 6 units. A torpedo launched is not regained and only accelerates on the same turn as the starship it was launched from. At the end of its movement a torpedo always turns to face its target.\bigskip

\subsection*{Win condition} Be the last starship standing.
